- You'll need to generate publishable and private keys from [Clerk](https://dashboard.clerk.com/).
- You'll need a database url, a good option is [Neondb](https://console.neon.tech/), create a cluster and get the database url.

3. generate the prisma schema and push it

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

4. run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. run the prisma studio to see the db:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```
