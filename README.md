This project is a clone of Discord web app, created to practice coding skills and try new implementations.

## Getting Started

1. install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. add enviroment variables:

- Create your .env file based on the .env.example
- You'll need to generate publishable and private keys from [Clerk](https://dashboard.clerk.com/)

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
